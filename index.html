        <h1>HTML :</h1>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to
            create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure and
            layout of a webpage using elements and tags. HTML is the backbone of all
            websites and works alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for
            interactivity).
        </p>
        <h1>CSS :</h1>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of a
            document written in HTML or XML. It separates content (defined using HTML) from design (implemented using
            CSS), enabling developers to build visually appealing, interactive, and responsive web pages. By separating
            structure and design, CSS improves maintainability and scalability in web development.</p>
        <h1>AWS :</h1>
        <p>
            AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.
            It offers a broad set of cloud services such as computing power, storage, databases, machine learning,
            networking, and more, enabling businesses and developers to build and scale applications quickly and
            cost-effectively.
        </p>
        <h1>
            GITHUB :
        </h1>
        <p>GitHub is a platform for hosting, version control, and collaboration, built around the Git version control
            system. It enables developers to work together on projects, manage code repositories, and track changes.
            GitHub is widely used for open-source projects, private development, and as a central hub for DevOps
            workflows.
        </p>
        <h1>JAVASCRIPT :</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that enables interactive functionality on
            websites. As one of the core technologies of web development (alongside HTML and CSS), JavaScript is
            essential for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
        </p>
        <h1>REACT</h1>
        <p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications
            where you need a fast, interactive experience. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React enables
            developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state and can be composed into complex
            UIs.</p>
        <h1>REDUX :</h1>
        <p>
            Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, primarily used with libraries like React for
            managing application state in a way that makes it easier to understand and debug. It helps manage the state
            of an application centrally, allowing for predictable state updates and making it easier to handle the
            complexity of state management in large applications.

        <h1>Node JS</h1>
        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run
            JavaScript on the server-side, outside of a browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was used only for client-side
            scripting, but Node.js enables it to be used for backend development, making it a powerful tool for building
            scalable and efficient web applications.</p>
        <h1>Mongo DB</h1>
        <p>MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL database management system that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like
            format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), which store data in tables
            with predefined schemas, MongoDB allows for a more flexible structure, making it easier to work with
            unstructured or semi-structured data.</p>
        <h1>SQL</h1>
        <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language designed for managing and manipulating
            relational databases. SQL is used to query, insert, update, and delete data, as well as manage database
            structures and relationships. It provides a declarative way to interact with a database, allowing users to
            describe the desired result without specifying how to achieve it.</p>
